      <li>1 medium Onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Cumin-Coriander Powder</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon Turmeric Powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon Garam Masala</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon grated Coconut</li>
      <li>1-2 Green Chillies, deseeded and chopped</li>

    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Wash bhindi in running water and dry them completely with cloth. If they
        are not completely dry, then they will turn sticky while cutting and
        cooking. Remove head and tail of it. Cut each one lengthwise and make
        long halves..
      </li>
      <li>
        Coarsely crush green chilli, ginger and garlic in grinder and make spicy
        ginger-garlic-chilli paste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 1½-tablespoons oil in a frying pan over medium flame. Shallow fry
        cut bhindi over medium flame until it turns dark green and shrinks,
        approx. 6-8 minutes. Sprinkle some salt over it, stir and cook for a
        minute. Turn off the flame and transfer to a plate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in pan. Sauté cumin seeds in it; when
        they begin to crackle, add green chilli-ginger-garlic paste (prepared in
        step 1) and sauté for a minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add finely chopped onion and mix well. Sprinkle salt (only for onion)
        and cook until it turns light brown.
      </li>
      <li>Add turmeric powder and garam masala, mix well.</li>
      <li>Now add shallow fried bhindi and cook for a minute.</li>
      <li>Add grated coconut, cumin-coriander powder and mix well.</li>
      <li>
        Turn off the flame and transfer prepared curry to a serving bowl.
        Garnish bhindi masala dry with coriander leaves and serve hot.
